The history of Vasai comes from ancient ages. One version of the origin of the name derived from Sanskrit word which means 'waas' or residence. The Portuguese influence is especially noticeable in Vasai and Virar. When Marathas invaded and colonized the region, they named it as 'Bajipura' or 'Bajipur'. But it did not stick. When England conquered the region from Marathas in the year 1774, they named it as Bassein region which is now called Vasai. Bassein was an important trading centre of that time. From 15th century it was ruled by Portuguese, followed by Diu and British This region has many Heritage installations.. The Bassein fort was initially built by Bahadurshah of Gujarat and further developed by Portuguese.",
